This directory performs double duty in our project.

First, it contains Erlang header files (.hrl), which are used to share macros 
and other features specific to the project with those that depend upon it.
Each project may have zero or more unique header files.

Second, it contains various files providing library functions across multiple
related projects.  These files are kept synchronized across projects during
development by way of the `make make' Makefile trigger.

The files to be found here are as follows:

    *.hrl       - Erlang header files specific to the project.  
                  [These files ARE NOT synchronized across projects.]
                  
    *.sh        - *NIX shell scripts used across projects.  
                  [Project-specific shell scripts belong the bin/ directory.]
                  
    *.mk        - Make libraries, providing standardized variables and
                  triggers that are then customized by the project Makefile.
                  
    *.configure - Alternative rebar configuration files, used to segregate
                  maintenance dependencies (such as those used for doc
                  generation) from runtime dependencies, and to resolve
                  namespace collisions between forked dependency versions.
    
    *.template  - Synchronized copies of files found in project root.  Used
                  to keep those root files up to date across projects.
