This directory holds .hrl Erlang library files, .mk Makefiles,
.sh Bash shell files, and a gitignore.template file.

The only .hrl files are those used by the nosh and pose-compatible
nosh subprojects.  These .hrl files are stored under the pose 
project and included using the -include_lib compiler directive.

The .mk and .sh files are used across all related projects, and
are synchronized between said projects for ease of access.  The master
copy of these files live under the nosh project.  All projects using
these files include a "make" target to their Makefile to synchronize
the files and pick up any changes.

The gitignore.template file serves to keep the .gitignore files of
all related projects synchronized.
