Utility scripts for testing and development.

 nosh - Run an interactive No-SQL Shell.
 
 pose - Run a single pose-style command.  (Wrapper for pose.escript.)
 
 dose - Run a pose-style command using development dependencies.
 
 folderl - Format lines containing Erlang terms to fit an 80-character display.
 
 wescript - Run an escript even if Cygwin is obscuring absolute pathnames.
 
 mkdev - Create a dev directory containing soft links to dependencies.*
 
 
    * Dependencies here are expected to be found in same working directory
      as nosh project.  Obviously, this script is only useful in development
      environment.
