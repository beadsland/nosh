Utility scripts for testing and development.  May not work on UNIXes that
do not support shebang chaining or nesting.  

Much of this functionality was originally coded as Makefile rules, but was
refactored here for sake of elegance.  However, if we later want to support
shebang-limited UNIXes, converting back to a Makefile architecture with
non-chained shell scripts as wrappers should be a trivial exercise.
